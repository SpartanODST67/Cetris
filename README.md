# Cetris
Tetris made in C and runs in powershell.<br>
<h2>Controls</h2>
- A: Move left.
- D: Move right.
- Q: Move counter clockwise.
- E: Move clockwise.

After running ./makefile.ps1, run ./Cetris.exe.<br>
<b>Epilepsy Warning:<b> The game repeatedly writes and clears the console which makes an obvious flickering effect.<br><br>

I might come back and update the game to include holding pieces, soft and hard drop, and improve overall performance and quality. However, this was just a short little distraction because I had a short little idea.
