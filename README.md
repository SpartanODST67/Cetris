# Cetris
Tetris made in C and runs in powershell.<br>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li>A: Move left.</li>
<li>D: Move right.</li>
<li>Q: Move counter clockwise.</li>
<li>E: Move clockwise.</li>
</ul>

After running ./makefile.ps1, run ./Cetris.exe.<br>
<b><i>Epilepsy Warning:</i></b> The game repeatedly writes and clears the console which makes an obvious flickering effect.<br>

I might come back and update the game to include holding pieces, soft and hard drop, and improve overall performance and quality. However, this was just a short little distraction because I had a short little idea.
